Title: Stock Price Prediction Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks

**Introduction:**
Stock price prediction is a challenging task that has garnered significant interest from researchers and investors alike. Accurate predictions can help traders make informed decisions and maximize their profits. One promising approach in the realm of stock price prediction is the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for their ability to capture sequential patterns in data. In this article, we will explore the concept of using LSTM neural networks for stock price prediction.

**Understanding LSTM:**
LSTM is a type of deep learning architecture specifically designed to model and predict sequences of data. Unlike traditional feedforward neural networks, LSTMs have an internal memory that allows them to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data. This makes them well-suited for time-series data, such as stock price history.

**Model Architecture:**
The LSTM model architecture consists of multiple LSTM layers followed by one or more fully connected layers. The LSTM layers are responsible for learning and capturing temporal dependencies in the data, while the fully connected layers are used for making predictions. The final layer typically has a single neuron, which outputs the predicted stock price.

**Current Project:**
The current project is for the prediction of stock price of sample data set of a random stock using the LSTM Neural Networks. The files test_data.csv is the data used for testing and training_data_set.csv is the training data.
